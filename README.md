# Bird Nest Video Processing

I have a security camera pointed at a nest. I've recorded some videos of the process of them constructing it. What I want to do is process a faster version (really fast, it starts with videos from some days to be resumed into a short video of the process).

To do so I use some image processing techniques to detect in which parts of the videos theres movement and make those parts a bit faster, leaveing the rest (no movement) to be MUCH faster :)
